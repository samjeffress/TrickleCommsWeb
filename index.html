  <h1 class="page-heading">Communication creating conversations</h1>
  <p>Enable great customer experiences by sending messages to your customers when you'll be ready to pickup their call. They'll love not having to listen to your call music!</p>
  <p>Instead of sending messages to customers in a big batch that's convenient for your business, but will cause your customers to join the queue to talk to you, Trickle Communications enables you to setup your batch of messages that will get delivered across the day - giving your customer service staff the time to respond to your customers. </p>
